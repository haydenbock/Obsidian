**Objectives**

The study aimed to examine how drought influences the interactions between roots and microorganisms in the rhizosphere under various plant community compositions. Specifically, it focused on the effects of drought on microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and enzyme activities in the rhizospheres of two grasses (Lolium perenne and Festuca arundinacea) and one legume (Medicago sativa), grown either individually or in a mixture, under controlled laboratory conditions. The research sought to understand the role of plant community composition in moderating the responses of microbial biomass production and extracellular enzyme activity to drought conditions.

**Results**

The study found that drought conditions led to a higher root-to-shoot ratio for all individual plant species, indicating that root growth was sustained under drought, whereas shoot growth was limited. However, when plants were grown in a mixture, the root biomass and root-to-shoot ratio decreased, suggesting that these plants competed more strongly for light rather than for water and nutrients compared to monocultures. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC) showed variable trends under monocultures in response to drought, but increased under the plant mixture. Enzyme activities responsible for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling exhibited over 90% variation due to drought and plant species composition. Most enzyme activities decreased in unplanted soil in response to drought, but the activity of enzymes involved in the N cycle increased under the plant mixture and two of the three monocultures, indicating an increased N demand under drought conditions.

**Implications**

The study suggests that drought and plant community composition significantly influence the functioning of soil microbial communities and their enzyme activities, which are crucial for soil organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling. These findings highlight the ecological importance of plant diversity and community composition in mitigating the impacts of drought on soil ecosystems. Specifically, the slower decomposition of plant residues and soil organic matter under drought conditions in mixed plant communities compared to monocultures could have implications for carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling in grassland ecosystems. This knowledge can inform strategies to manage plant communities for ecosystem resilience to climate change.

**Objectives**

The study aimed to investigate how soil water content influences the spatiotemporal distribution of root exudates in the rhizosphere. By examining maize plants grown under varying moisture conditions, the research sought to understand the effects of drought on root growth, carbon (C) allocation to roots, and the resulting changes in rhizosphere water content. The study employed a combination of techniques, including ^14C labeling of plants, phosphor imaging to estimate carbon allocation in roots, and neutron radiography to visualize rhizosphere water content. A numerical model was also used to predict exudate release and its distribution along and around growing roots.

**Results**

The study found that despite similar levels of ^14C allocation into roots under dry and wet conditions, root elongation decreased by 48% in dry soil, reducing the longitudinal extension of the rhizosphere. Interestingly, the rhizosphere water content remained constant at 31% across different moisture conditions, likely due to the high water retention capabilities of mucilage. The model predicted that increased rhizosphere water content under dry conditions would enhance the diffusion and microbial decomposition of exudates.

**Implications**

This research suggests that root growth and rhizosphere water content are crucial factors in determining carbon release by roots and the distribution of root exudates within the rhizosphere. The release of mucilage under water-limited conditions appears to be a strategic response by plants to maintain efficient diffusion of exudates and high microbial activity in the rhizosphere. These findings have implications for understanding plant-soil interactions, especially under conditions of water scarcity, highlighting the adaptive mechanisms plants employ to modulate rhizosphere processes and potentially mitigate drought stress effects.

**Objectives**

The review aimed to identify, address, and rank knowledge gaps in our understanding of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) interactions across a range of scales, from molecular to global. The study focused on five major topics related to soil C and N interactions: 1) N control over soil emissions of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), 2) plant utilization of organic N, 3) the impact of rhizosphere priming on C and N cycling, 4) the influence of black N on the stabilization of soil organic matter (SOM), and 5) the representation of SOM fractions in models at various scales.

**Results**

The review highlighted that knowledge generally decreases as the scale increases for four of the five topics, with the exception of SOM simulation models, which appear to have a higher level of understanding at the ecosystem scale. The most significant knowledge gaps were found at the global modeling scale, with a notable need for a reliable quantification of greenhouse gas emissions at the ecosystem scale to improve soil-climate representation in General Circulation Models (GCMs). Key questions include the role of different N species for the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition rates and its consequences for plant-available N.

**Implications**

The review underscores the critical importance of understanding soil C and N interactions for predicting the impacts of climate change. It points out the necessity of addressing knowledge gaps, particularly at larger scales, to refine our predictions of global climate change impacts.

**Objectives**

The study reviewed the current understanding of how crop roots respond to drought stress, emphasizing the molecular mechanisms of morphological, physiological, and metabolic responses. It also examined the role of soil nutrients and rhizosphere microorganisms in these responses. The review aimed to consolidate knowledge on how root growth and architecture are regulated under water-deficit conditions, how these responses are modulated by the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), the impact of nutrients on crop root responses to drought, and the dynamics between crops and soil microbes under such conditions.

**Results**

Root Growth and Architecture: Under drought, crop roots exhibit specific changes in growth and architecture, including adjustments in root length, diameter, surface area, tissue density, biomass, and branching. These changes are regulated by essential genes and metabolic processes that help the plant access deeper soil water resources.

Molecular Mechanisms: The article highlighted the role of ABA in mediating root responses to drought, including root-to-shoot communication and modulation of root growth. It also discussed the regulation of cellular metabolism in response to drought, such as osmotic adjustment, cell-wall modification, and antioxidant activity.

Nutrient Regulations: The review discussed how responses of crop roots to altered water status are impacted by nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur) and vice versa.

Crop-Microbe Interactions: The study explored how drought affects the interaction between crops and rhizosphere microbes, emphasizing the potential of manipulating rhizosphere microorganisms to enhance crop resilience to water stress.

**Objectives of the Study**

The study aimed to explore how drought influences plant-soil feedbacks with implications for microbial mediation of plant community dynamics. Specifically, it tested the hypothesis that drought modifies plant-soil feedback, impacting plant competition and investigated the mechanisms involved by assessing responses of soil microbial communities and nutrient availability.

**Results**

Previous drought significantly altered bacterial and fungal community composition, decreasing plant growth in conspecific soils and affecting plant competitive interactions.

Plant and microbial responses to subsequent drought depended on the legacy effect of the previous drought on plant-soil interactions.

Drought had lasting effects on belowground communities, influencing plant-soil feedbacks and plant-plant interactions. This suggests that increased drought frequency may alter soil functioning and plant community composition through changes in plant-soil feedbacks.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

The study's findings indicate that drought's legacy effects on plant-soil interactions can significantly influence belowground community dynamics, with broad implications for ecosystem responses to climate change. By altering plant-soil feedback mechanisms and competitive interactions among plants, drought may affect soil functioning and plant community structure in the long term, highlighting the need to consider these legacy effects in predicting ecosystem responses to climate variability.

**Objectives of the Study**

This study aimed to investigate the effects of drought seasonality and plant community composition on the resistance and resilience of two dominant perennial grasses in a dryland ecosystem. Specifically, it examined how concurrent and legacy effects of seasonal drought (cool-season and warm-season) influence soil moisture, phenology, and biomass of Achnatherum hymenoides (C3 photosynthesis) and Pleuraphis jamesii (C4 photosynthesis), and how these effects are modulated by the presence of a large shrub, Ephedra viridis.

**Results**

Drought treatments had significant concurrent and legacy effects on soil moisture, particularly at shallow depths, impacting the phenology and biomass of both grass species.

Drought reduced the growing season length by altering the timing of green-up and senescence for both species.

Biomass and phenological responses to drought differed between the two grasses, with limited evidence that shrub presence significantly altered these effects.

Positive and negative legacy effects on soil moisture were observed, with drought treatments leading to prolonged changes in soil moisture availability, which subsequently affected plant growth and competitive interactions in subsequent seasons.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

The study highlights the significant role of drought seasonality and plant community composition in determining the drought resistance and resilience of dryland ecosystems. It demonstrates that both abiotic (soil moisture) and biotic (plant growth and interactions) legacies of drought can have lasting impacts on ecosystem dynamics. These findings are crucial for understanding how increased drought frequency and intensity under climate change may affect dryland ecosystems, which are characterized by high sensitivity to water availability. The study underscores the need for considering both current and historical drought effects in predicting and managing the responses of dryland ecosystems to climate change.

[https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23042374](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23042374)

**Objectives of the Study**

This study aimed to systematically investigate the impacts of drought stress on root exudates and root-associated microbiomes of crop plants, and to discuss the mutual regulation between root-associated microbiomes and the host plant in adapting to drought conditions. It sought to construct a framework elucidating the interplay between plant root exudates and microbiomes under drought stress, aiming to provide insights for enhancing plant resistance to drought through the manipulation of rhizosphere microbiota.

**Results**

Drought stress was found to significantly alter the composition and quantity of plant root exudates, including an increase in organic acids which may aid in plant resistance to osmotic stress.

Changes in root exudates under drought conditions influenced the rhizosphere microbiome, affecting the composition and function of microbial communities associated with the plant roots.

The study highlighted the reciprocal influence between plants and their associated microbiomes in response to drought, where plants modify root exudates to influence microbial communities, and in turn, certain microbes help improve plant tolerance to drought stress.

It was observed that the presence of certain plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) and fungi (PGPF) in the rhizosphere could enhance plant growth and drought resistance by altering nutrient availability and hormonal regulation.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

The findings of this study underscore the critical role of the interactions between plant root exudates and root-associated microbiomes in the adaptation of plants to drought conditions. Understanding these interactions offers significant potential for improving crop resilience to drought stress through the management of rhizosphere microbiota. The research provides a theoretical basis for developing agricultural practices that exploit beneficial soil microbiomes to enhance crop production under increasing drought scenarios, a growing concern with climate change. This study suggests that future efforts should focus on identifying specific microbial communities and root exudate compounds that promote drought resistance, paving the way for innovative strategies in sustainable agriculture and crop management.

**Objectives of the Study**

This study aimed to understand how drought affects root traits and responses across global ecosystems. Specifically, it sought to examine the impact of drought on 17 variables associated with root traits using data synthesized from 128 published studies under field conditions. The objectives were to (a) examine global patterns of drought-induced changes in root traits and responses and (b) investigate how functional types (e.g., woody and herbaceous plants) and experimental conditions (e.g., drought duration and intensity) regulate root traits and related responses to drought.

**Results**

The meta-analysis revealed that drought significantly reduced root length and root length density by 38.29% and 11.12%, respectively, but increased root diameter by 3.49%. Notably, drought also increased the root:shoot mass ratio and root cortical aerenchyma by 13.54% and 90.7%, respectively. These changes suggest that drought predominantly modifies root morphological traits, leading to increased root mortality. Consequently, the drought-induced decrease in root biomass was less than that in shoot biomass, resulting in a higher root:shoot mass ratio. The study also highlighted the variability in response to drought across different plant functional types and experimental conditions.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

The findings underscore the need to incorporate root traits into terrestrial biosphere models to enhance predictions of climate–biosphere feedbacks under changing environmental conditions. Understanding how drought influences root traits and responses is crucial for predicting vegetation dynamics and ecosystem carbon cycling under climate change. The study's comprehensive analysis of drought's impact on root morphological traits and biomass contributes significantly to our understanding of plant adaptation strategies to drought, with implications for biodiversity conservation, agricultural practices, and climate change mitigation efforts.

**Objectives of the Study**

This research aimed to investigate the direct and indirect effects of drought on soil microbes and the microbial turnover of recent plant-derived carbon in a mountain meadow. The study specifically focused on how drought influences soil microbial community composition, the allocation of recent plant-derived carbon to microbial groups, and the impact of drought on belowground carbon allocation processes.

**Results**

The study found that severe experimental drought significantly increased microbial biomass in plots exposed to drought compared to controls. Additionally, drought led to a shift in the microbial community composition, predominantly driven by an increase in Gram-positive bacteria. Drought reduced the belowground carbon allocation but did not affect the transfer of recently plant-assimilated carbon to fungi. Notably, it resulted in reduced tracer uptake by bacteria and an increase in extractable organic carbon (EOC) during drought, further pronounced after mowing the plots.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

The findings of this study highlight the complex interactions between plant and microbial responses to environmental stressors such as drought. By demonstrating that drought weakens the link between plant and bacterial carbon turnover but not fungal carbon turnover, this research contributes to our understanding of ecosystem carbon dynamics under changing climatic conditions. The increased growth of potentially slow-growing drought-adapted soil microbes, like Gram-positive bacteria, underlines the importance of microbial community composition in mediating ecosystem responses to drought. This knowledge is crucial for predicting how future climate change scenarios, characterized by more frequent and severe droughts, might affect carbon cycling and storage in terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in mountain meadows.

Drought intensity alters productivity, carbon allocation, and plant nitrogen uptake in fast versus slow grassland communities. *Journal of Ecology*, 111(8), 1681–1699. https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.14136

**Objectives of the Study**

The study aimed to examine how drought intensity affects plant productivity and plant–soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in grassland communities with contrasting resource acquisition strategies (fast vs. slow strategy). Specifically, it sought to identify thresholds in plant community productivity in response to increasing drought intensity, explore shifts in plant–soil C and N dynamics across these thresholds, and assess how these dynamics differ between plant communities with contrasting strategies during and after drought.

**Results**

The study found that slow-strategy plant communities were more drought resistant than fast-strategy communities, with a higher drought intensity threshold before a significant reduction in productivity occurred. Upon recovery, fast-strategy communities demonstrated greater compensatory growth compared to slow-strategy communities. Drought intensity influenced carbon uptake, reducing it significantly during peak drought, but its effects on carbon allocation varied. Post-drought recovery saw shifts towards increased allocation of recently acquired carbon to extractable organic carbon and microbial biomass, signaling a quick microbial recovery. Moreover, drought intensity affected plant–soil nitrogen dynamics, increasing soil nitrate and dissolved nitrogen post-drought. Leaf nitrogen concentration increased with past drought intensity in both plant community types, but whole-plant nitrogen uptake significantly increased in the fast-strategy community only.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

This study highlights the complex interplay between drought intensity, plant resource acquisition strategies, and plant–soil carbon and nitrogen cycling in grassland ecosystems. The findings suggest that drought resistance and recovery capacity are contingent upon plant community composition and that drought intensity triggers nonlinear responses in plant productivity and soil nutrient dynamics. These insights are crucial for understanding the resilience of grassland ecosystems to drought and for predicting the impacts of future climate change scenarios on terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The study emphasizes the need for incorporating plant community composition and resource acquisition strategies into models predicting ecosystem responses to drought, which could improve the management and conservation of grassland ecosystems under changing environmental conditions.

**Objectives of the Study**

The study aimed to understand how summer drought affects belowground carbon allocation dynamics, specifically the allocation of recently assimilated carbon among different carbohydrate pools and root respiration in a mountain meadow. It combined experimental rain exclusion with ^13C pulse labeling to analyze these effects and how they are partitioned among various root carbohydrate pools and root respiration.

**Results**

The results showed that severe soil moisture deficit caused by summer drought decreased ecosystem carbon uptake and the amount and velocity of carbon allocated from shoots to roots. Despite this, the proportion of recently assimilated carbon translocated belowground remained unchanged. Root respiration decreased under drought, reflecting reduced carbon demand, and was increasingly sustained by carbon reserves, while recent assimilates were preferentially allocated to root storage and an enlarged pool of osmotically active compounds.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

These findings indicate that during drought conditions, the usage of recent photosynthates shifts from supporting metabolic activity to facilitating osmotic adjustment and accumulating storage compounds. This shift has significant implications for understanding plant responses to drought, emphasizing the role of carbon allocation strategies in plant resilience. It highlights the need for further research into how plants prioritize carbon usage under stress conditions, which is crucial for predicting plant behavior and ecosystem functioning under changing environmental conditions, especially with the expected increase in frequency and severity of drought events due to climate change.

**Objectives of the Study**

The study aimed to investigate how drought modifies plant-soil feedbacks and plant-plant interactions with a focus on microbial mediation of plant community dynamics. The researchers hypothesized that drought would alter plant-soil feedbacks with implications for plant competition. They assessed net pairwise plant-soil feedbacks for two grassland plant species in soils that had been subjected to previous drought and were then exposed to a subsequent drought. Additionally, they examined the effects of previous drought on soil microbial communities and nutrient availability to understand the mechanisms behind these changes.

**Results**

The study found that previous drought had a lasting effect on bacterial and fungal community composition, which in turn decreased plant growth in conspecific soils and altered plant competitive interactions. Moreover, plant and microbial responses to a subsequent drought were dependent on the legacy effect of the previous drought on plant-soil interactions. This suggests that drought not only directly affects plant growth and soil microbial communities but also indirectly influences plant competition and community dynamics through changes in plant-soil feedback mechanisms.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

The findings indicate that drought has lasting effects on belowground communities with consequences for plant-soil feedbacks and plant-plant interactions. This highlights the importance of considering the legacy effects of extreme climatic events like drought on ecosystem functioning and plant community composition. The study suggests that increased frequency of drought, as predicted under climate change scenarios, could alter soil functioning and plant community dynamics through modifications in plant-soil feedbacks, thereby impacting biodiversity and ecosystem resilience. Understanding these complex interactions is crucial for predicting and managing the impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems.

**Objectives of the Study**

The study aimed to investigate how drought affects the distribution of root exudates in the rhizosphere by examining changes in root growth, carbon allocation to roots, and rhizosphere water content. The authors used 14C labeling of plants coupled with phosphor imaging to estimate carbon allocation in roots, visualized rhizosphere water content with neutron radiography, and employed a numerical model to predict exudate release and its distribution along growing roots.

**Results**

The study found that drought conditions did not significantly change the total amount of 14C allocated into roots but led to a 48% decrease in root elongation in dry soil, resulting in a reduced longitudinal rhizosphere extension. Despite varying soil moisture levels, rhizosphere water content remained similar across treatments due to high water retention by mucilage. The model predicted that increased rhizosphere water content would enhance the diffusion of exudates, particularly in dry soil, and increase their microbial decomposition.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

The findings highlight the importance of root growth and rhizosphere water content in the release and distribution of carbon in the rhizosphere. Mucilage release by roots may be a strategy for maintaining efficient exudate diffusion and high microbial activity under water-limited conditions. This work contributes to our understanding of plant-soil interactions and the mechanisms by which plants adapt to drought, offering insights for future research on soil carbon cycling and the resilience of plant communities to climate variability.

**Objectives of the Study**

This review aimed to discuss the impacts of drought stress on the soil microbial community, abundance, structure, and activity, and on plant growth and development. It focused on how drought stress affects microbial activity in the soil environment, particularly in terms of soil enzyme activities, pools, fluxes, and processes of terrestrial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles. The study also aimed to explore the role of soil microorganisms in mitigating the effects of drought on plants, including changes at the transcriptomic and metabolomic levels.

**Results**

The review highlighted that drought stress significantly decreases microbial abundance, disturbs microbial structure, declines microbial activity including enzyme production (e.g., oxidoreductases, hydrolases, dehydrogenase, catalase, urease, phosphatases, β-glucosidase), and negatively affects nutrient cycling, leading to a decrease in soil fertility and plant productivity. However, the addition of organic substances such as compost, sewage sludge, or municipal solid waste can mitigate these negative effects by increasing the activity of soil enzymes. Drought directly affects plant morphology, anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry, with changes observable at the transcriptomic and metabolomic levels. The review also emphasizes the potential of rhizosphere microbial communities, particularly plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) and fungi (PGPF), to adapt their structural and functional compositions to water scarcity, thus mitigating drought stress effects on plants.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

The findings underscore the critical role of soil microorganisms and their interactions with plants in responding to and mitigating the effects of drought stress. Understanding these interactions is essential for developing strategies to enhance soil and plant resilience to drought conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for informing agricultural practices and ecosystem management in the face of increasing drought occurrences due to climate change. The review calls for further research into the metagenomics of soil microorganisms under drought conditions and highlights the importance of incorporating soil microbial dynamics into models predicting ecosystem responses to environmental stressors.

**Objectives of the Study**

The study aimed to understand the complex interactions and responses of plants, soils, and rhizosphere environments to drought stress. It reviewed the effects of drought stress on plant morphological structure, photosynthesis, stomatal regulation, reactive oxygen species metabolism, antioxidant protection mechanisms, osmotic regulation, endogenous hormones, leaf chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, polyamines, xylem hydraulic characteristics, carbon-nitrogen metabolism, autophagy, and molecular responses. Additionally, it examined how drought stress affects soil aggregates' stability, soil nutrients, plant root exudates, soil enzyme activity, soil microorganisms, soil respiration, and soil carbon and nitrogen emissions.

**Results**

The study synthesized findings from various sources to illustrate how drought stress leads to significant changes in plant morphology, physiology, and biochemistry, including reduced photosynthesis, altered stomatal behavior, increased reactive oxygen species, and enhanced antioxidant defense mechanisms. It also highlighted the impact of drought on soil properties, such as decreased soil aggregate stability and changes in soil nutrient availability. Furthermore, the study detailed the role of plant endogenous hormones in mediating responses to drought stress and discussed the importance of osmotic regulation and the accumulation of polyamines in helping plants tolerate water deficit conditions.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

This comprehensive review underscores the intricate network of responses and adaptations by plants, soil, and rhizosphere environments to drought stress. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of drought on agricultural systems and natural ecosystems. The study suggests future research directions, including the need for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying plant responses to drought, the development of drought-resistant crop varieties, and the exploration of innovative agricultural practices to enhance soil water retention and plant resilience to drought. The findings have broad implications for improving plant productivity under drought conditions, enhancing soil health, and ensuring sustainable agricultural practices in the face of changing climate patterns.

**Objectives of the Study**

The study aimed to examine the effects of drought on carbon allocation and rhizosphere-mediated CO2 fluxes in grassland soil cultivated with three plant species: Lolium perenne, Festuca arundinacea, and Medicago sativa, grown either in monocultures or in a mixture. Using 14C pulse labeling, the study traced carbon allocation to shoots, roots, soil, rhizospheric CO2, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass under drought and optimum water conditions to evaluate changes in rhizosphere processes occurring in response to drought.

**Results**

The study found that drought significantly affected the assimilate allocation within the plant-soil system, altering the source-sink relationships. Drought conditions led to a relatively larger portion of assimilates being transferred to the roots in monocultures compared to conditions of water sufficiency. However, in plant mixtures, there was an increase in 14C allocation to shoots under drought. Root respiration decreased under drought for all monocultures, except under the legume species (Medicago sativa), where it remained similar across treatments. Drought led to increased allocation of assimilates to easily available exudates or rhizodeposits, indicating a significant alteration in carbon allocation and belowground carbon fluxes influenced by plant community composition. The presence of legume species attenuated drought effects on rhizosphere processes.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

This study highlights how drought and plant community composition significantly influence carbon allocation and rhizosphere processes in grassland ecosystems. The findings underscore the complex interplay between plant response strategies and microbial activity under drought stress, with implications for understanding ecosystem carbon dynamics under changing environmental conditions. The research suggests that plant community composition, particularly the inclusion of legume species, can modify the impact of climatic changes on belowground carbon allocation and fluxes. This knowledge is crucial for predicting ecosystem responses to drought and for managing grasslands to enhance resilience to climate variability.

**Objectives of the Study**

The study aimed to investigate how drought affects the interaction between experimental grassland communities and soil microorganisms. It specifically explored the mechanisms behind drought-induced decoupling of plant photosynthesis and microbial carbon cycling and its recovery after rewetting. The research sought to understand how root exudation during drought is linked to pulses of soil microbial activity and changes in plant nitrogen uptake post-rewetting, utilizing ^13C-CO2 pulse labeling to trace the flow of assimilates into plants and the soil's water-extractable organic carbon and microorganisms.

**Results**

Drought significantly impacted the plant community, reducing aboveground biomass while increasing root biomass, leading to a higher root:shoot ratio. Despite reduced photosynthetic rates and total plant ^13C uptake, the proportion of ^13C allocated belowground remained unchanged during drought. Drought led to an accumulation of ^13C tracer in water-extractable soil organic carbon, indicating continued root exudation. In contrast, the amount of ^13C tracer assimilated into soil microorganisms was significantly reduced, more severely affecting growth-related lipid biomarkers than metabolic compounds. Upon rewetting, the carbon uptake into metabolic and growth-related compounds from rhizospheric microorganisms quickly recovered, likely related to increased nitrogen supply to plant shoots.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

This study highlights the critical role of root exudation in maintaining soil microbial activity during drought and its significance in facilitating ecosystem recovery after rewetting. The findings demonstrate that drought-induced decoupling between plant photosynthesis and soil microbial carbon cycling is primarily due to reduced carbon uptake and metabolic turnover in rhizospheric soil microorganisms. The maintenance of root exudation during drought supports a rapid reinitiation of soil microbial activity after rewetting, enhancing plant recovery through increased nitrogen availability.

**Objectives of the Study**

The study aimed to explore how climate change might affect soil microbial communities, particularly focusing on the impact of drought on the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) and soil CO2 emissions. It investigated the changes in microbial community structure, particularly between bacterial and fungal diversity, under drought conditions in two representative Mediterranean ecosystems subjected to long-term precipitation/throughfall exclusion. The study hypothesized that drought would alter the microbial community, favoring drought-resistant fungi, which in turn would affect the decomposition of SOM and its temperature sensitivity.

**Results**

The study found that fungal diversity was less sensitive to seasonal changes compared to bacterial diversity, indicating fungi's better adaptation to varying moisture and temperature conditions. Over ten years of precipitation/throughfall exclusion, fungi showed greater resistance compared to bacteria. The results suggested that under future drier conditions projected for Mediterranean regions, fungal-dominated microbial communities might become more prevalent. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that the fungal community significantly influenced the temporal and spatial variability of SOM decomposition and its sensitivity to temperature, indicating fungi's crucial role in the decomposition of terrestrial SOM, particularly under the harsh environmental conditions of Mediterranean ecosystems.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

The findings highlight the significant role of drought-resistant fungi in controlling soil organic matter decomposition and its response to temperature in Mediterranean ecosystems. This has important implications for understanding how microbial communities adapt to climate change, particularly in terms of drought resistance. The study suggests that future climate change, with expected drier conditions in Mediterranean regions, might shift soil microbial communities towards fungi dominance. This shift could have profound effects on soil carbon cycling, affecting soil respiration rates and carbon sequestration capacities. Understanding these microbial-mediated processes is crucial for predicting and managing the impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems.

**Objectives of the Study**

The study investigated the legacy effects of extreme experimental droughts on plant and microbial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) turnover during a naturally occurring drought and subsequent rewetting in a mountain grassland. The researchers conducted a ^13C pulse-chase experiment to trace ^13C allocation belowground and its incorporation into soil microbes using phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers. They aimed to assess how prior exposure to experimental droughts affects plant and microbial responses to future drought and rewetting events.

**Results**

The study found that plants with a drought history (DH) assimilated and allocated less ^13C belowground during the natural drought, and fine root respiration was reduced compared to plants in ambient controls (AC). Microbial biomass remained stable across conditions, but microbial communities initially differed in composition between soils with and without DH. During the natural drought, gram-positive bacteria increased while fungal and gram-negative bacteria remained stable. Soils with DH showed a strongly reduced uptake of recent plant-derived ^13C in microbial biomarkers during the natural drought, suggesting a smaller fraction of active microbes or a microbial community less dependent on plant C.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

The study's findings indicate that a history of drought can induce changes in plant nutrient concentrations and affect the response of plant C turnover to further droughts by decreasing plant C uptake and below-ground allocation. This does not affect the responses of the microbial community to further droughts and rewetting but alters microbial functioning, particularly the turnover of recent plant-derived carbon. The research highlights the importance of considering the historical environmental conditions when studying plant-soil interactions and microbial community dynamics in response to climatic changes, such as increased frequency and severity of drought events.

**Objectives of the Study**

The study aimed to explore how soil moisture affects the dynamics of soil organic matter and is an important variable in predicting changes in soil carbon stocks from site to global scales. It focused on understanding the mechanisms determining the response of heterotrophic soil respiration to soil moisture, which are poorly quantified and typically represented in most current carbon cycle models as simple empirical functions. The objectives were to provide an overview and new insights into the mechanisms involved in the respiration-moisture relationship, starting with calculating best estimates of average empirical relationships using published data and comparing the results for contrasting soil types.

**Results**

The study found that soil moisture significantly influences the dynamics of soil organic matter through its effects on heterotrophic soil respiration. Empirical models were evaluated, and the paper provided a quantitative comparison of different moisture units to predict organic matter decomposition. It was determined that relative water saturation and water potential are better predictors of soil microbial activity across different soils compared to other moisture measures. The study also explored theoretical linkages between substrate and gas diffusivity in soil pores and heterotrophic respiration as a function of texture and temperature. Additionally, it highlighted the importance of transient CO2 efflux-moisture relationships, particularly focusing on the 'Birch effect', and gave an overview of recent pore-scale models to gain a more mechanistic understanding of carbon storage and stabilization in variably saturated soils.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

The findings indicate that current empirical models, while useful, are limited approximations with questionable predictive capacity for understanding soil moisture effects on soil respiration. Significant efforts are necessary to represent the full range of soil moisture responses in a unifying model with a sound theoretical basis that can help identify common underlying processes. The study underscores the critical role of soil moisture in affecting soil carbon dynamics and the need for a better mechanistic understanding of these effects to predict changes in soil carbon stocks accurately under changing environmental conditions.

**Objectives of the Study**

This chapter discusses the various impacts of climate change on plant-microbe interactions within agroecosystems. The objectives include examining how elevated CO2 levels, increased temperatures, and drought conditions affect beneficial microbes and microbial processes. Additionally, it aims to understand the effects of climate change on host-pathogen interactions, biocontrol agents, and the behavior and fate of xenobiotics in the soil environment.

**Results**

- **Elevated CO2**: Increased atmospheric CO2 concentration enhances plant growth and alters root exudation patterns, potentially increasing carbon flow to soil microbes and affecting microbial community structure and function.

- **Elevated Temperature and Drought**: These conditions can significantly impact microbial community structure, reducing the abundance of certain microbes while favoring drought-resistant fungi. Drought conditions also reduce the formation of mycorrhizal mycelium in plant roots, affecting plant growth and nutrient uptake.

- **Host-Pathogen Interactions**: Climate change may alter the incidence and severity of plant diseases by changing the environmental conditions favorable for pathogen development and modifying plant-pathogen interactions.

- **Biocontrol Agents**: Climate change can impact the effectiveness of biological control agents, potentially leading to ecosystem imbalances and affecting the management of invasive species.

- **Xenobiotics**: Climate change, along with agricultural practices, can influence the distribution and degradation of xenobiotic compounds in soil, affecting microbial community structure and function.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

The chapter highlights the complex and varied effects of climate change on plant-microbe interactions within agroecosystems. These interactions are crucial for ecosystem function, plant health, and agricultural productivity. Understanding these dynamics is essential for developing strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on agricultural ecosystems and ensure food security. Future research directions include the use of "omics" technologies to further explore microbial dynamics and the development of climate-resilient agricultural practices.

Stability of above-ground and below-ground processes to extreme drought in model grassland ecosystems: Interactions with plant species diversity and soil nitrogen availability. *Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics*, 14(3), 193–204. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ppees.2011.12.001

**Objectives of the Study**

The study aimed to investigate the short-term effects of a simulated 100-year summer drought event, soil nitrogen (N) availability, and plant species diversity (low/high) on key ecosystem processes related to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in model systems of two commonly occurring temperate grassland communities. The research focused on how these factors interact to affect whole ecosystem CO2 fluxes, leaching losses, litter decomposition, and C/N stocks in vegetation, soil, and soil microbes during and post-rewetting from drought.

**Results**

The study found that experimental drought caused significant reductions in ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem CO2 exchange, and adversely affected root C stocks and litter decomposition across all N and plant diversity treatments. However, ecosystem fluxes recovered rapidly following rewetting, irrespective of N and species diversity. Drought increased soil water retention, organic nutrient leaching losses, and soil fertility. The drought responses of above-ground vegetation C stocks varied depending on plant diversity, with greater stability of above-ground vegetation C to drought in the high versus low diversity treatment. This positive effect of high plant diversity coincided with a decrease in the stability of microbial biomass C. Soil N availability had limited effects on the stability of ecosystem processes to extreme drought.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

The findings indicate that extreme drought events promote post-drought soil nutrient retention and soil fertility, with cascading effects on ecosystem C fixation rates. The data on above-ground ecosystem processes underline the importance of species diversity for grassland function in a changing environment. Furthermore, the results suggest that plant-soil interactions play a key role in the short-term stability of above-ground vegetation C storage to extreme drought events. The study contributes to our understanding of how extreme weather events like drought impact ecosystem structure and function, highlighting the complex interplay between abiotic and biotic factors in determining ecosystem stability.

Effects of climate extremes on the terrestrial carbon cycle: concepts, processes, and potential future impacts. *Global Change Biology*, 21(8), 2861-2880. https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12916

**Objectives of the Study**

The study aimed to integrate current understanding of how climate extremes impact the terrestrial carbon cycle. By examining ecosystems' structural, compositional, and functional responses to extreme climatic events, the researchers sought to:

1. Develop a conceptual framework for understanding the direct and indirect effects of climate extremes on the carbon cycle, including the main mechanisms and processes involved.

2. Synthesize the impacts of different types of climate extremes (droughts, heat waves, heavy precipitation, etc.) on various ecosystems (forests, grasslands, peatlands, croplands) and their carbon cycling processes.

3. Discuss potential future impacts of climate extremes on the global carbon cycle, considering changes in the frequency, intensity, and nature of these events due to climate change.

**Results**

The review highlighted several key findings:

- Climate extremes can have profound immediate (direct) and delayed (indirect and legacy) effects on the terrestrial carbon cycle, affecting both carbon uptake and release processes.

- The impact of climate extremes on ecosystems and their carbon cycling processes varies significantly across different ecosystem types, with forests expected to exhibit the largest net effects due to their substantial carbon pools and fluxes.

- Future climate change is expected to alter the frequency and intensity of climate extremes, potentially exacerbating their impact on the terrestrial carbon cycle. This includes increased risks of droughts, heatwaves, and extreme precipitation events, which could lead to enhanced carbon release from terrestrial ecosystems or changes in their carbon sequestration capacities.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

This comprehensive review underscores the complexity of interactions between climate extremes and the terrestrial carbon cycle. It highlights the importance of understanding these dynamics to predict and manage the impacts of climate change on global carbon–climate feedbacks. The findings suggest that ecosystems' responses to climate extremes could significantly influence future climate change trajectories by either amplifying or mitigating atmospheric CO2 levels. The study calls for more research to refine the conceptual framework and improve predictions of climate extremes' impacts on the carbon cycle, crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change.

**Objectives of the Study**

This study aimed to synthesize current knowledge on the impact of drought on rhizodeposition, the release of organic compounds from plant roots into soil. The research sought to identify how water stress affects rhizodeposition, its variability with changes in drought severity, and the consequent effects on soil microbial communities and ecosystem resilience.

**Results**

The review found that moderate drought tends to increase rhizodeposition per unit of plant biomass, suggesting plants may allocate more carbon belowground to mitigate stress effects. However, under severe drought conditions, rhizodeposition becomes more variable. The study also noted that the total amount of rhizodeposits entering the soil might decrease due to concurrent reductions in plant biomass under drought conditions. Impacts on rhizodeposition were found to be species-dependent, potentially leading to varied effects on soil communities. The review highlighted the need for more advanced studies on rhizodeposition to understand plant-soil interactions and their response to drought better.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

This study underscores the complexity of plant responses to drought and the significant role of rhizodeposition in mediating soil microbial communities and ecosystem processes. Understanding the dynamics of rhizodeposition under drought conditions is crucial for predicting ecosystem resilience and developing strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems. The findings suggest that future research should focus on identifying the mechanisms behind changes in rhizodeposition under drought and their consequences for soil health and ecosystem functioning.

**Objectives of the Study**

The study aimed to understand how drought impacts root-associated bacterial communities, considering both direct effects (through moisture availability) and indirect effects (via altered soil chemistry and plant phenotypes). It sought to synthesize observed trends in bacterial community responses to drought, including changes in composition, abundance, and activity, and to explore the interplay between soil, plant responses, and microbe interactions under drought conditions.

**Results**

- **Soil Bacteria Community Responses to Drought**: Drought was found to directly affect soil bacterial communities by selecting for desiccation-tolerant taxa and indirectly through altered soil chemistry and diffusion rates. Commonly observed trends include a decrease in total bacterial biomass, relatively stable community diversity, and a significant impact on community composition, notably an increase in the ratio of Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria.

- **Plant Responses to Drought**: Plants undergo a series of physiological responses to drought, including alterations in root exudate profiles and root morphology, which influence the recruitment and composition of root-associated bacterial communities. Drought typically increases the allocation of carbon belowground and changes the quality and quantity of root exudates, impacting microbial recruitment and activity.

- **Role of Bacteria in Plant Growth Promotion Under Drought**: Bacterial communities play a critical role in supporting plant growth under drought conditions through various mechanisms, including phytohormone production, nutrient cycling, and altering plant gene expression. Plants may recruit specific bacterial taxa with beneficial traits under drought, contributing to plant resilience and adaptation.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

This review highlights the complexity of interactions between plants and their associated microbial communities under drought conditions. Understanding how drought influences root-associated bacterial communities is essential for predicting plant resilience to drought and developing strategies to enhance plant growth under water-limited conditions. The findings suggest that future research should focus on identifying mechanisms behind observed shifts in microbial communities and the specific roles of beneficial microbes in supporting plant growth under drought stress. This knowledge is crucial for improving agricultural productivity and ecosystem stability in the face of increasing drought occurrences due to climate change.

**Objectives of the Study**

The study explores the adaptations and physiological acclimation mechanisms that allow microorganisms to survive and remain active under environmental stress. It examines the implications of microbial responses to stress, particularly focusing on drought and freezing, for ecosystem-level carbon (C), energy, and nutrient flows. The research aims to understand the costs of physiological responses to stress at the organism level and how these responses can lead to shifts in ecosystem function through direct effects on microbial physiology and by influencing the composition of the active microbial community.

**Results**

The study found that environmental stresses, particularly drought and freezing, impose significant physiological costs on soil microbes, which can lead to substantial shifts in the allocation and fate of carbon and nitrogen in ecosystems. For example, to survive a single drought episode, soil microbes may consume up to 5% of the total annual net primary production in grassland ecosystems. Acclimating to freezing conditions changes Arctic tundra soils from immobilizing nitrogen during the growing season to mineralizing it during the winter. The research highlights that even if the microbial community response to stress is limited, the physiological costs imposed on soil microbes are significant enough to potentially cause large shifts in ecosystem function.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

This study underscores the critical role of microbial stress-response physiology in determining ecosystem function under varying environmental conditions. The findings suggest that stress-induced changes in microbial physiology and community composition can have profound impacts on ecosystem-level carbon, energy, and nutrient flows. The research emphasizes the importance of integrating microbial ecology into ecosystem ecology to achieve a more complete understanding of how ecosystems function and respond to environmental stresses. This integration is crucial for predicting the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and developing effective conservation and management strategies.

Climate extremes and the carbon cycle. *Nature*, 500(7462), 287–295. https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12350

**Objectives of the Study**

This study aimed to understand the impact of climate extremes on the terrestrial carbon cycle, focusing on how these events affect carbon uptake and storage across different ecosystems. The research sought to identify the processes through which climate extremes, such as droughts and storms, influence the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems and to estimate the potential future impacts of these events on the global carbon budget.

**Results**

The research revealed that climate extremes can significantly reduce regional ecosystem carbon stocks and potentially offset the expected increase in global terrestrial carbon uptake. The study examined the mechanisms through which climate extremes affect the carbon cycle, including direct impacts on photosynthesis and respiration, as well as indirect effects through changes in ecosystem structure and function. It highlighted the significant role of droughts in altering the carbon cycle, with impacts varying across ecosystems. The study also presented a synthesis of observations and modeling efforts to estimate the susceptibility of the carbon cycle in different ecosystem types to climate extremes.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

The findings suggest that climate extremes could have substantial impacts on the terrestrial carbon cycle, potentially leading to large shifts in carbon stocks and fluxes. This has significant implications for predicting and managing the effects of climate change on terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem services. The study calls for improved understanding and modeling of climate extremes and their impacts on the carbon cycle to better predict future carbon-climate feedbacks. It also emphasizes the need for targeted research and observation efforts to elucidate the complex interactions between climate extremes, ecosystem responses, and the global carbon budget.

**Objectives of the Study**

This study investigated the effects of dry-rewetting cycles on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in soils, focusing on the process of rhizodeposition (the release of organic compounds from plant roots into the soil), its utilization by microbes, and its stabilization in the soil mineral phase. Additionally, the study explored how these cycles influence N mineralization and loss. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) was grown under constant moisture and dry-rewetting conditions, utilizing continuous ^13C-labeling to differentiate between plant and soil organic matter contributions to soil pools, and ^15N labeling to determine N loss.

**Results**

Dry-rewetting cycles were found to decrease the total input of plant C into microbial biomass and the soil mineral phase, primarily due to a reduction in plant biomass. There was a positive correlation between plant-derived C in microbial biomass and in the soil mineral phase. N loss was reduced with dry-rewetting cycles, and N mineralization increased after each rewetting event. The study demonstrated that dry-rewetting cycles primarily affect rhizodeposition and the stabilization of new C through biomass reduction. However, the frequency of rewetting and the intensity of drought might determine the fate of C in microbial biomass and consequently in the soil mineral phase, as well as stimulating N mineralization and reducing N loss in agricultural soils.

**Implications for the Broader Subject**

The findings highlight the significant impact of dry-rewetting cycles on soil C and N dynamics in agricultural systems. By elucidating the mechanisms through which drying and rewetting affect plant-soil interactions, the study provides insights into how these processes can influence the stability of C in the soil and the cycling of N. These results are particularly relevant in the context of climate change, where increased variability in precipitation patterns may lead to more frequent and intense drying and rewetting cycles. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing management practices that enhance soil health, crop productivity, and ecosystem resilience in the face of changing environmental conditions.
